# Complete Central Backup

## Description

Lets face it! 
Losing your data is always breath taking. Its like losing your wallet.

Complete Central Backup allows for backups to be made on the fly. There are some backup plugins out right now but sometimes they just get too clunky and are hard to follow. We designed this plugin for the normal user with a clean and simple dashboard to go along with WordPress 3.8.

NOTE: If you are upgrading from 1.0.5 to 2.x.x, please download you backups manually before upgrading. BACKUPS WILL BE LOST IF YOU SIMPLY UPGRADE WITHOUT DOING SO.

Included Features:

* ONE CLICK to create a backup of your database or file system.
* Schedule weekly, monthly or daily backups of your database or entire WordPress install.
* Enable or disable backup notifications when a scheduled backup is ran.
* Ability to upgrade the plugin and or WordPress without losing any backup data.
* Download your backups for safe keeping.
* New component structure to support future features.

All support matters are recommended to be place at our <a href="http://blackbirdi.com/2012/10/25/complete-central-backup-wordpress-plugin/">blog</a>. This way you will get a response sooner as this plugin has limited support.
